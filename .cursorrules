- Place main package in cmd/ directory
- Place reusable code in pkg/ or internal/
- Use Go modules for dependency management
- Follow Go naming conventions (camelCase for unexported, PascalCase for exported)

## Testing
- Write table-driven tests where appropriate
- Use subtests for related test cases
- Aim for meaningful test coverage
- Mock external dependencies

## Documentation
